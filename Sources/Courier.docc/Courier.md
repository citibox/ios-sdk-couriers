Library and example of how to integrate with Cibitox services for deliveries

## Installation

Add this Swift Package to your application in Xcode: `git@github.com:citibox/ios-sdk-couriers.git`

## Usage

This framework is developed in `SwiftUI`. The provided functionality comes along with a function extending the `View` protocol.
Then, you need to add the `.courier()` modifier to your main view providing all [required parameters](#entry-params) and it will open a `CourierView` in full screen. Once process is done you will be able to receive some callback [results](#results). 

### Entry params

| Param            | Type    | Requirement | Description                                                                         |  
|------------------|---------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `accessToken`    | String  | Mandatory | Access token provided via oauth for Citibox server to the Carrier server. Important: The carrier app should never contact the citibox server directly.                                              |  
| `tracking`       | String  | Mandatory | Scanned barcode or QR code of the package to be delivered.                                                     |   
| `recipientPhone` | String [Format E.164] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) | Recipient mobile phone number.                                         |  
| `dimensions`     | String? | Optional | Package height , width and length in millimetres in the following format:{height}x{width}x{length} Ex.: 24x50x75                                        |  
| `bookingId`      | String | Optional | Booking identificator. |
| `isSandbox`      | Bool | Optional | Tells if using sandbox environment. False by default. |
| `debug`          | Bool | Optional | Shows a different view in order to be able to debug the delivery. Is intended to be used when we face some issue that cannot understand or we want to verify params or UI. False by default.¬†|

### Results
There are 4 types of results:
- [Success](#success)
- [Failure](#failure)
- [Cancel](#cancel)
- [Error](#error)

A result is represented by the protocol `DeliveryResult` which specializes in its own type.

#### Success
When the delivery went well, the result will give you an instance of `DeliveryResultSuccess` with information about the delivery like:

- `boxNumber`: it's the box number where the parcel were delivered
- `citiboxId`: our ID to allow you to link your delivery with our ID
- `deliveryId`: the ID of the delivery

#### Failure
When the delivery couldn't be executed for some reason related to the Box or the user, you'll receive an instance of `DeliveryResultFailure` with the field `code` telling you what went wrong.

#### Failure codes
|Code|Description|
|--|--|
|`parcel_not_available`|  |
|`max_reopens_exceed`|  |
|`empty_box`|  |
|`box_not_available`|  |
|`user_blocked`|  |
|`user_autocreation_forbidden`|  |
|`any_box_empty`|  |

#### Cancel
When the delivery couldn't be done because the Courier canceled the delivery on purpose, you'll receive an instance of `DeliveryResultCancel` with the field `code` with the code.

#### Cancel codes
| Code                 | Description                                                                                                                     |

| `parcel_mistaken`    | The courier starts the delivery and the data inserted belongs to another package (a wrong package).                             |

#### Error
When there is an error in the data preventing the delivery, you'll receive an instance of `DeliveryResultError` with the field `code` with the code that helps you to identify what is wrong in the data.

    @State var showCourierView = false
    
    var deliveryParams = DeliveryParams(
        accessToken: "accessToken",
        tracking: "tracking",
        recipientPhone: "+34600000000"
    )

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Deliver üöÄüì¶") {
